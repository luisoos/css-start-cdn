# CSS Start with CDN
Quick start with CSS: just drop in the CDN into your HTML <head> and you have all things normalized in your CSS.

## CDN
```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luisoos/css-start-cdn/main/startercdn.css```

# Documentation
### Installation
  - Just drop the CDN above into your `<head>`-element in your HTML file, and you should be all set up.
  
### More Classes
  - Center a text quickly using the class `text-center`
  - Center something  by using margin with the class `center-marg` (centres a lot of things!)
  
  - `color-black` to make a text black
  - `color-white` to make a text white
  
## Why this project?
  When I am creating a new CSS file I hate to normalize everything normal and that's why I always keep copying my standard things from previous projects. To make this easier, I created this easy CDN, so I can start faster and open-sourced it because I thought others could need it as well. This is no big project or anything, just something to facilitate your work.
